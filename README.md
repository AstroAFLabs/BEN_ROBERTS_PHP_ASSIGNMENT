# BEN_ROBERTS_PHP_ASSIGNMENT
PHP_Assignment_4
I am new to Github. So, this may be the third time I've committed or pushed or whatever the heck GH calls it. I'm not quite across all that yet. These are the PHP files pertaining to my big PHP assignment. The task is to build and operate a small business database, with the added tasks of setting cookies, hashing passwords, storing users, deleting and adding products and storing and retrieving said cookies and also images. I'm having problems getting my head around it, but then I don't pretend to be a coder. I'm just learning. If anyone wants to lend a hand, I'm making this repository public. Feel free to take a look and offer advice or suggestions. Cheers, Ben.
